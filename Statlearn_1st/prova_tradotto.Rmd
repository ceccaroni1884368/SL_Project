# Prediction and analysis of air quality
Riccardo Ceccaroni, Giusy Beatrice Colarusso, Gabriele Giannotta, Francesco Lauro


Abstract
----------
Air pollution is one of the big issues that affect metropolitan areas all around the world. Traffic and factories play a significant role. We need to implement models that keep track of data about the concentration of air pollutants (SO2, NO2, etc.). Indeed, the diffusion of these toxic gases in the air affects people’s quality of life. The increase in data availability and new discoveries in terms of computational technologies are making it possible to predict and analyse the air quality, providing extremely useful information to control air pollution.





Main research aim \& framework
----------
The main goal of the project is to find a model that manages to predict air quality. Our interest in this topic stems from the fact that we think it's important to know more about air quality situation. Indeed, we strongly believe that predictions could help reducing pollution. Living in a “unique” historical period, namely the Covid-19 pandemic, a secondary goal of our research is understanding if this virus, besides changing our habits, has had an effect on air quality.



Data source(s) 
----------
Data will be collected on a daily basis (about 4 records per day) from the Air Quality Programmatic APIs website. They will be collected into a dataframe through our own Python script. This script connects directly to the website using APIs, and requests the air quality data measured in any data-gathering entity in the city of Rome. Each record will be used to fill in a dataframe which will be saved into a .csv format file. Finally, all these dataframes will be merged together.




Data collection
----------
From each data-gathering station we will collect the following data: date, time, location, $AQI$ index, carbon monoxide $CO$, nitrogen dioxide $NO_2$, ozone $O_3$, sulphur dioxide $SO_2$, particulate matter $PM_{10}$, particulate matter $PM_{2.5}$, humidity $h$, pressure $p$, temperature $t$, and wind speed $w$.

The main concern in recording data is that data-gathering entities are uploaded at a different time during the day, and some of them are updated only once a day. 
For this reason, we could be having some stations with more recordings than others.



Model \& Methods
----------
The two models we want to test are the following:

1. __Multiple Additive Regression Trees__: a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees [@wiki:Gradient_boosting], [@article7]. 


2. __ARIMA Model__: a generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. Both of these models are fitted to time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future points in the series [@wiki:Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average], [@article4]. 



Software/Hardware Toolkit
----------
Up to this point, the only programming language we have been using is \textit{Python}.

It will be the main language we are going to use for the entire data analysis, together with \textit{R}.  Moreover, we will probably employ [gbm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbm/gbm.pdf) and [stats](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/stats-package.html).
